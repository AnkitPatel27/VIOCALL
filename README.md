# VIOCALL 
This is Nodejs video calling app.
We can also chat with the other user in real time and for this purpose socket.io is used.
For getting live video stream of the other users I have used peer.js 
As we get to website we can either start or join a meet via link ,as we join a meet other user get a message in chat box and can also able to see the live video stream of new user joined. 
The live interaction with other users is managed by socket.io
